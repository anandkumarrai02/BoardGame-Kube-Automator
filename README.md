The primary purpose of this project is to automate the software delivery lifecycle, from code compilation to deployment, thereby accelerating time-to-market, enhancing product quality, and reducing manual errors. The key objectives include:

- Establishing a seamless CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins to automate various stages of the software delivery process.
- Integrating essential DevOps tools such as Maven, SonarQube, Trivy, Nexus Repository, Docker, Kubernetes, Prometheus, and Grafana to ensure comprehensive automation and monitoring.
- Improving code quality through static code analysis and vulnerability scanning.
- Ensuring reliable and consistent deployments on a Kubernetes cluster with proper load balancing.
- Facilitating timely notifications and alerts via email integration for efficient communication and incident management.
- Implementing robust monitoring and alerting mechanisms to track system health and performance.

## Tools Used
- **Jenkins:** Automation orchestration for CI/CD pipeline.
- **Maven:** Build automation and dependency management.
- **SonarQube:** Static code analysis for quality assurance.
- **Trivy:** Vulnerability scanning for Docker images.
- **Nexus Repository:** Artifact management and version control.
- **Docker:** Containerization for consistency and portability.
- **Kubernetes:** Container orchestration for deployment.
- **Gmail Integration:** Email notifications for pipeline status.
- **Prometheus and Grafana:** Monitoring and visualization of system metrics.
- **AWS:** Creating virtual machines.

## Deployment Phases

**Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup**
- Built a robust network environment for seamless communication.
- Set up a Kubernetes cluster for container orchestration.
- Implemented Jenkins for CI/CD automation.
- Integrated SonarQube for code quality analysis.
- Configured Nexus as the artifact repository.
- Deployed monitoring solutions for real-time insights.

**Phase 2: Private Git Repository**
- Created a secure private Git repository.
- Implemented token-based authentication.
- Ensured version control by pushing source code to the repository.
